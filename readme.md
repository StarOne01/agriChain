# ðŸŒ¾ AgriChain â€“ Decentralized Marketplace for Farmers & Consumers

## Project Overview

AgriChain is a blockchain-powered platform connecting farmers directly with consumers, eliminating intermediaries and ensuring transparency in the agricultural supply chain. The platform leverages blockchain technology to create a trustless environment for agricultural trade.

## Features

- **Direct Farmer-to-Consumer Marketplace**: Eliminates middlemen to improve farmer earnings and consumer prices
- **Blockchain-Verified Transactions**: Ensures transparency and traceability
- **Farmer Profiles**: Allows farmers to showcase their products and practices
- **Order Management**: Comprehensive system for tracking purchases
- **Product Listings**: Detailed product information including origin and farming methods
- **User Authentication**: Secure login system for farmers and consumers

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB (with Mongoose)
- Blockchain integration (likely Ethereum/Solidity)
- RESTful API architecture

### Frontend
